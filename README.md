# Weather Webpage using HTML and JavaScript

The Weather Webpage project is a simple web application that displays weather information for a given location. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface and fetch weather data from an API.

## Features

The Weather Webpage project includes the following features:

1. Location Input: Users can enter the name of a city or a specific location to fetch weather information.

2. Weather Display: The webpage fetches weather data from a weather API and displays relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

3. Dynamic Content: The webpage dynamically updates the displayed weather information based on the user's input.

4. Error Handling: The application handles errors gracefully and displays appropriate error messages if the entered location is not found or if there are issues with fetching the weather data.

## Project Structure

The project can be organized into the following files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage. It includes the necessary HTML elements for input fields, weather display, and error messages.

2. `styles.css`: The CSS file that provides the styling for the webpage. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.

3. `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the dynamic behavior of the webpage. It includes functions to fetch weather data from the API, update the displayed information, and handle user interactions.

## Getting Started

To run the Weather Webpage project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project.

2. Inside the project directory, create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files mentioned above.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the webpage.

## Usage

1. Open the webpage in a web browser.

2. Enter the desired location (e.g., city name) into the input field.

3. Press the "Submit" button or hit the "Enter" key to fetch and display the weather information for the entered location.

4. The webpage will update with the fetched weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

5. If there are any errors in fetching the weather data or if the location is not found, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

6. To fetch weather data for a different location, clear the input field and enter a new location.

## Conclusion

The Weather Webpage project provides a basic web application for displaying weather information. It demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and dynamic user interface. You can further enhance the project by adding features like displaying weather icons, including a forecast for multiple days, or implementing geolocation to fetch weather data based on the user's current location.
